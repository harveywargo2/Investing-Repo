## General Notes
>They are speculators. Speculators hope that the price of a stock will go up and reward them with profits. Investors know that stocks that pay dividends go up too. Meanwhile, they are getting a return on their capital. They believe the old adage: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

>Investors also donâ€™t have to be particularly talented, but they do have to be disciplined. At the end of the day, if you work hard and are smart enough to save money, then you are entirely capable of managing it.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 159). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

>Generating sufficient cash to meet your needs will be a primary objective until you die. If you have loved ones you are responsible for, they will continue to need cash after you die. During the employment years, you must make wages, salaries, and bonuses do double duty, providing for current needs while investing for the future. Optimally, the invested cash will generate sufficient interest, dividends, and capital appreciation to meet your future needs when your wages, salaries, and bonuses are no longer your primary sources of income. Your long-term challenge then will be to balance your cash flow between your current cash needs and your need to accumulate cash for the future. Your level of success in this endeavor can be positively impacted by a modicum of financial planning.

>If you know what your goals and objectives are, you are well on your way to achieving investment success. At the end of the day, successful investing is realized by three activities: know the end goal(s) of why you are investing; use an investment approach that makes sense to you and can generate returns sufficient to meet your goals; and, keep an eye on taxes and expenses.

>Once you have the end in mind there is only one thing you need to understand about investing: The sole purpose of investing is to grow your capital and income base to meet a current or future cash need.

## Dividend Value Strategy
>According to the Dividend-Yield Theory, the price of a stock is driven by its yield.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 29). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

>The underlying premise of the dividend-value strategy is that the dividend yield is the major driver for the price of a stock.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 51). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

>As a general rule, a stock is overvalued when it has a relatively high price and a low dividend yield. It is undervalued when it has a relatively low price and a high dividend yield.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 62). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

>Some stocks are undervalued when their yields are 4 percent, 5 percent, or 6 percent. Others may be equally undervalued on the basis of their historic profiles of dividend yield when their yields are 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent. The point is that each stock has established its own profile of value, its own individual parameters of dividend yield, and each stock must be evaluated individually.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 125). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 


## Stock Investing
>When an investor buys shares of stock, he buys part ownership of a corporation. The return on a stock investment comes in two forms: capital appreciation (an increase in share price) and dividends, which we will discuss in greater detail shortly. Unlike a fixed-income investment, common stocks pay no fixed rate of interest and offer no guarantees for the return of capital.

Wright, Kelley. Dividends Still Don't Lie (p. 33). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

>Traditionally there are three fundamental measurements of value: price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (PB), and dividend yield. What is immediately apparent with the two ratios is that they are centered on price. Price, without substantive context, is meaningless.
